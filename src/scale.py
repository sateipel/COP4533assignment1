# TASK C
# Scalability
#Measure the running time of your matching engine on an increasingly larger number of 
# hospitals/students, i.e., n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 and graph the 
# running time as a line graph when n on the x-axis and the running time on the y-axis.
#   Do the same for the verified.  What is the trend that you notice? Note: How you measure 
# the running time is up to you (there are multiple ways of doing this) and will likely 
# depend on which programming language you choose.
